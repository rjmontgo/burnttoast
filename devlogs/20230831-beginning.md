# The start

It has been a week since I got the news that I would be laid off. Didn't come as a surprise to anyone, 
we were a startup with a little revenue, but not enough. 

Sometimes, that's how it happens. It's hard to explain the mixture of anxiety and dread that set in when 
I got the news. It is a bit like seeing a spider on the ceiling just before you turn out the light - it isn't
terrifying, but the feeling is always there. 

I took some time to try and reflect, but really just flailed my arms. I hadn't done the things to make 
my resume look good. I had done projects outside of work, but I can't put them on my resume because I 
had them in a private repo for a website for my brother. I did not have any contributions to open source
I hadn't done 1-2 leet code problems a day for the past two years. I hadn't even updated my resume
in a long time because I had gotten all my previous jobs through networking. My github was severely
lacking with activity.

Many of the people I worked with would tell you I was a great engineer, but if that's the case why does
it feel like I'm starting over from square one? 

That's why losing a job, especially losing your first job can be incredibly overwhelming. Because the delta from
where you are to where you need to be seems massive. What used to be a quick slack or linkedin message now may
take multiple weeks or months. The Venn diagram of 'the skills you need to get a job' vs 'the skills you need to retain a job'
is smaller than you expect. And so with all of that in mind I just applied to a bunch of jobs on otta. In retrospect, 
I think I just craved the feeling of knowing I could at least get an interview, but when the third rejection hit my 
inbox I had a bit of a mental break. Each rejection only reinforced the idea that I haven't sent out my resume enough, 
and so I updated it and sent more. On and on... You can guess where this leads. To make things worse it felt as though
none of the recruiters shared my sense of urgency (obviously, they likely get hundreds or thousands of applicants).

I think this comes from the fact that I felt I had done everything right. I'm a good team player, I finish my tickets,
I do my best at work. And yet, despite checking all the right boxes I still found myself without a job and no easy way
to get one. 

## the good part

Eventually, after playing a match of a tennis, I had a deep sense of calm set over me. I realized for the first time
that I finally have the time to work on cool projects that interest me. I have enough money saved up that I would be okay,
and if I was scrappy I could hold off and come back to the industry when I was ready.

Then I got it. One of the nice things about stress and frustration is that if you work through you end up with 
clarity. There's an old saying, "The truth is supposed to hurt, that's how you know ya don't got it." I realized I had
been playing the wrong game when it comes to getting and keeping a job.

I wanted the fast and easy solution when if such a thing existed everyone would be doing it. I have often wanted to
attempt some challenging projects, but I put them off because they were too hard or would require too much time I didn't 
have. Now I understand, that if a project is trivial to do it usually isn't interesting (unless you are a college grad
or very junior). 

But now that I don't have a job I suddenly have a lot of free time to work on hard projects that impress.

## Advice

* Touch grass, go outside, work up a sweat, tire yourself out. Once you've done that you'll see that all 
  the nagging voices in your head aren't as loud.

* Reflect, accept the fact that this may take longer than you want. Hey, we all want to get lucky and 
  get back into employment as fast as possible, but 

* Talk to people, I'm so thankful for the people in my life (yes, those outside my career) that have
  been there for me. If you have good people in your life they'll be the first to tell you when you are
  overreacting.

  The point is you may feel alone, but you aren't.
