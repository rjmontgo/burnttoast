# Burnt Toast Project 

A fast-paced multiplayer video game, loosely based on [Boomerang Fu](https://www.boomerangfu.com/).  

## Motivation

I have done a lot of JSON API engineering in my career, and this seemed a good change of pace. It has a lot of things
I like:

- Video Games
- Python

And a lot of things I want to learn more about:

- Three.js
- 3D Modeling
- Client/server state reconciliation over a web socket

## Development Setup

<details>
<summary> Nix [Recommended] </summary>

1. Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/download)
   
2. **(Option 1 [Recommended] - Autoload)** Install [Direnv](https://direnv.net/)

    * This enables Nix to load your environment in your preferred shell every time you `cd` into it.
    * Once installed, allow direnv to use the flake directory with `direnv allow .`
    * This will install all needed project dependencies and drop you in your preferred shell
  
3. **(Option 2 - Manual)** Run `nix develop`

    * This will also install all needed project dependencies and drop you in a bash shell with those dependencies loaded into your path.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why did you use nix? What is nix?</strong></summary>

  [Nix](https://nixos.org/) is a functional DSL for specifying reproducible builds and deployments. As to why, because
  Nix simplifies my setup (even if it does look a little weird) and grants me a higher granularity of 
  control over my installed packages. 
  
  It also means that if anyone wants to run this on their own machine I don't have to worry as much
  about any dependency resolution issues they may have. Unfortunately, while Python is a great language
  it has some packaging issues, [relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1987/). It's not the only language with 
  this type of problem (ðŸ‘€ Javascript & NPM). 
  
  I __might__ add virtualenv support in the future: it seems like the most sensible option, but
  I'm happy with Nix for now.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Why Python</strong></summary>

  Because it's easy to work with, has tons of library support, and is a language 
  I'm comfortable with.
